# Implimenting BackPropagation
In this project, its implemented a neural network with back propagation. The dataset for this task is an identity matrix with 8 nodes, where a unique input
vector with a single active ”1” and the remaining elements as ”0.” The goal is to train the network to reproduce each input vector as its output, demon- strating the effectiveness of back propagation in learning specific input-output relationships.
